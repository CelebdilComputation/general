Greetings,
My Name is Justin S. and I am a Senior Computer Engineering/Physics Major at UHCL
I have decided on the brand name of Celebdil Computation as it represents the Peak of Middle Earth and the site of of one of the most notable battles
I will be attempting to operate this account as a Design Log about the Robotics and Circuitry Projects I have planned
